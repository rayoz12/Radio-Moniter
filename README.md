Moniter the tracks playing through the API for a radio station

# Context
In early 2017 a radio station called WSFM ran a contest where the first to call in about a song that ran twice in the day would win. Unfortunately I didn't win but it was fun while it lasted.

# What this does
With the contest in mind I created this piece of js code that using the undocumented API for the online station got the current song and checked if it had been played on the current day. It also stores the song title's to a file so you have have a look at them later.
